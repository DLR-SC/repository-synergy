# syms2elf

The plugin export the symbols (for the moment only functions) recognized by IDA Pro and radare2 to the ELF symbol table. This allows us to use the power of IDA/r2 in recognizing functions (analysis, FLIRT signatures, manual creation, renaming, etc), but not be limited to the exclusive use of this tools.

Supports 32 and 64-bits file format.

## INSTALLATION

  * **IDA Pro**: Simply, copy `syms2elf.py` to the IDA's plugins folder.
  * **radare2**: You can install via r2pm: `r2pm -i syms2elf`



## EXAMPLE

Based on a full-stripped ELF:

```
$ file test1_x86_stripped 
test1_x86_stripped: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, stripped
```

Rename some functions in IDA or r2, run `syms2elf` and select the output file.

After that:

```
$ file test1_x86_unstripped 
test1_x86_unstripped: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped
```

Now, you can open it with others tools and analyzing in a more comfortable way.
