The picoCTF platform is the infrastructure which is used to run
[picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/).

The platform is designed to be easily adapted to other CTF or programming
competitions.

If using the platform to host a custom competition, we recommend using the most recent tagged [release](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF/releases). The `master` branch represents active development and may not be stable. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the stability or security of any outdated releases.

Additional documentation can be found at [docs.picoctf.com](https://docs.picoctf.com) or within the [`/docs` directory](./docs/README.md).

covered in our documentation: https://discord.gg/WQGdYaB

## Quick Start

The following steps will use [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to get you
quickly up and running with the picoCTF platform by deploying the code base to
two local virtual machines.

1. `git clone --branch v19.0.1 -c core.autocrlf=false https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF.git`  
   (see [this
   link](https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF/issues/68#issuecomment-346736808)
   for an explanation of this command line)
2. `cd picoCTF`
3. `vagrant up`
4. Navigate to http://192.168.2.2/
5. Register an account (this user will be the site administrator)

If you want to change CTF Placeholder, edit
picoCTF-web/web/_includes/header.html

There are now quick ways to change the memory, number of CPUs and IP addresses and run multiple instances.

After you do the git clone, rename picoCTF to picoCTF_XXX (fill in XXX with something unique for each)
Start by running a command like the below. 
J is the number of CPUs
M is the amount of memory in GB
SIP is shell IP address (default is 192.168.2.2)
WIP is web IP address (default is 192.68.2.3)

J=2 M=6 SIP=192.168.2.53 WIP=192.168.2.52 vagrant up shell && SIP=192.168.2.53 WIP=192.168.2.52 vagrant up web

### Quick start on two existing machines (not Vagrant VMs)

On each machine:
1. `git clone https://github.com/picoCTF/picoCTF`
2. SHELL ONLY: sudo visudo and add NOPASSWD for your user for at least /picoCTF-env/bin/shell_manager. (Don't remove your ability to do other sudos with a password!)
3. `chmod og-rx picoCTF`
4. `sudo ln -s picoCTF /picoCTF`
5. `bash picoCTF/vagrant/provision_scripts/install_ansible.sh`
6. `cd picoCTF/ansible`
7. edit inventories/local_development to match your hostnames
8. edit group_vars/local_development/vars.yml to have your username and password (instead of vagrant). If the usernames on your machines don't match, change shell_user also.
9. SHELL ONLY: `ansible-playbook --ask-sudo-pass -e "web_address=http://WEB_HOSTNAME web_address_internal=http://WEB_HOSTNAME shell_hostname=SHELL_HOSTNAME shell_host=SHELL_HOSTNAME shell_port=22" -i inventories/local_development -v -l shell site.yml` (replace WEB_HOSTNAME and SHELL_HOSTNAME with yours)
10. WEB ONLY: `ansible-playbook --ask-sudo-pass -e "web_address=http://WEB_HOSTNAME web_address_internal=http://WEB_HOSTNAME shell_hostname=SHELL_HOSTNAME shell_host=SHELL_HOSTNAME shell_port=22" -i inventories/local_development -v -l web,db site.yml` (replace WEB_HOSTNAME and SHELL_HOSTNAME with yours)


## Project Overview

This project is broken down into a few discrete components that compose to build
a robust and full featured CTF platform. Specifically the project is consists of
the following:

1. [picoCTF-web](./picoCTF-web). This is the website and all APIs.
2. [picoCTF-shell](./picoCTF-shell). This is where users go to solve challenges.
3. [problems](./problems). This is the CTF problems source code.
4. [ansible](./ansible). This is used for configuring machines.
5. [terraform](./terraform). This is used for deployment.
5. [vagrant examples](./vagrant). This hosts various vagrant VM examples.

### Walkthrough

Once you bring everything up, the main flow between components is:

![Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

Here is a walkthrough:
1. The user connects to the "Web Server". This is an nginx server.
   - The nginx server serves up content in [picoCTF-web/web](picoCTF-web/web).
   - The nginx server only serves up static HTML files.
   - Most HTML files contain javascript, which is rendered browser-side for
     speed.
   - The browser rendering in turn makes requests to a REST-ful like API `/api/`
     to nginx. Requests to `/api` are forwarded to an API server (running on the
     same host for development).
   - There is a special interface called `/admin`, which is used by the admin to
     connect to new shell servers.
2. The users `/api` request is forwarded to the API server.
   - The API server is a python flask server with code under
     [picoCTF-web/api](picoCTF-web/api)
   - There is an API for adding users, checking passwords, etc.
   - There is an API for serving up challenges, checking flags, etc.
   - The API keeps track of user score and membership to teams.
3. A user can `ssh` to the shell server.
   - The shell server is loaded with problems, with examples in
     [problems](problems/).
   - The web server connects to the shell server and retrieves a JSON file
     containing problem instance location, point value, etc.
   - The web server authenticates users using password data stored and via the
     API.

Some important terminology:
+ A _problem_ is a logical CTF problem. (Sometimes called a _challenge_)
  + Solving a problem gives a user points.
  + A problem can be _locked_ or _unlocked_ for a user.
  + Super important: problems *do not* have flags. They are purely logical.
+ A _problem instance_, or _instance_ for short, is a generated version of a
  challenge to be solved by a user.
  + A single problem can have instances `inst_1`, `inst_2`, ..., `inst_n`. Each
    instance has its own flag `flag_1`, `flag_2`, ..., `flag_n`
  + Users are assigned specific problem instances, and they are expected to
    submit only their flag. For example, if user Foo has instance `inst_1`, only
    `flag_1` is a valid flag (aa separate instance flag `flag_2` is not valid)
  + Instances were invented to help combat flag sharing. If player Foo has been
    assigned `inst_1` but submits `flag_2`, then whomever has `inst_2` shared
    their flag. There may be legitimate reasons for flag sharing, but in many
    competitions it is indicative of cheating.
  + Instances are generated from _template_. Think of it like templating in a
    web framework. For example, a buffer overflow problem may template the
    specific buffer size so a solution for `inst_i` will not work for `inst_j`.

### picoCTF-web

The competitor facing web site, the API for running a CTF, and the management
functionality for CTF organizers. The development [Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile))
deploys picoCTF-web to a virtual machine (web) at http://192.168.2.2/. If you
want to modify the look and feel of the website, this is the place to start.

### picoCTF-shell-manager

The tools to create, package, and deploy challenges for use with the picoCTF
platform. This supports the deployment of auto-generated challenge instances and
provides competitors shell access to aid in challenge solving. The development
[Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile) deploys the shell-server as a second virtual
machine (shell) at http://192.168.2.3/. If you want to modify challenge
deployment primitives, this is the place to start.

### picoCTF Compatible Problems

Example challenges that are compatible with the picoCTF platform. These
challenges can be easily shared, deployed, or adapted for use in a CTF. The
development [Vagrantfile](./Vagrantfile) installs these examples to the shell
server and loads them into the web interface. If you want to see how to create
challenges or leverage the hacksport library, this is the place to start.

### Ansible for Automated System Administration

The tool we use to install, configure, deploy, and administer the picoCTF
platform is [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). This allows us to create
flexible, parameterized, automated playbooks and roles that apply across
development, staging, and production environments. If you want to modify way the
platform is configured, this is the place to start.

### Terraform for automated AWS deployment

The tool we use to codify our infrastructure as code is
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/). This allows a simple process for
creating, destroying, and managing a public deployment of the platform. If you
want to run a live competition on AWS, this is the place to start.

## Running Your Own Competition

If you are looking to run your own CTF competition, you should:
1. Make sure you understand how to deploy the infrastructure via terraform and
   ansible.
2. You can reskin the look and feel of the site by editing the
   [picoCTF-web/web](picoCTF-web/web) javascript and HTML code.
3. To enable password reset emails, log in using the site administrator 
   account and configure Email under Management > Configuration. 
4. You should start writing your own problems, loading them into the shell
   server, and syncing the web server problem set with the shell server via the
   `/admin` URL endpoint.

Do not underestimate the importance of spending significant time in problem
development. Our internal system is:
1. We form a working group for the contest.
2. We often vet problem ideas with the group before implementation.
3. Implement and deploy. Hardcode nothing (or as little as possible).
4. *THE KEY STEP:* Play test! Often the initial problem will have an
   intellectual leap built-in that's obvious to the creator but to no one
   else. Play testing makes sure the problem is coherent, self-contained, and
   fun.

## Giving Back and Development

The picoCTF platform is always under development.
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setting up a git workflow and some
  standards.
- We are especially interested any improvements on continuous integration and
  automated testing.

If you are interested in research in CTFs (e.g., improving skill acquisition,
decreasing time to mastery, etc.), please feel free to email David Brumley.

## Credits

picoCTF was started by David Brumley with his CMU professor hat in 2013. The
intention has always been to give back to the CTF community.

The original heavy lifting was done by his graduate students, and special thanks
is due to Peter Chapman (picoCTF 2013 technical lead) and Jonathan Burket
(picoCTF 2014 technical lead) for their immense efforts not only developing
code, but for organizing art work, problem development, and so on.

In 2015-2016 significant effort was done by
[ForAllSecure](https://forallsecure.com) at the companies expense. This includes
adding concepts like the shell server, and rewriting significant portions of the
web server.

Both CMU and ForAllSecure have agreed to release all code under the [MIT
LICENSE](./LICENSE) . We do encourage attribution as that helps us secure
funding and interest to run picoctf year after year, but it is not
necessary. Also, if you do end up running a contest, do feel free to drop David
Brumley a line.
