## Overview
This document provides step by step instructions to install the Arduino Yún SDK and connect your device to the AWS IoT.  
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK consists of two parts, which take use of the resources of the two chips on Arduino Yún, one for native Arduino IDE API access and the other for functionality and connections to the AWS IoT built on top of [AWS IoT Device SDK for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python).
### MQTT connection
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK provides APIs to let users publish messages to AWS IoT and subscribe to MQTT topics to receive messages transmitted by other devices or coming from the broker. This allows to interact with the standard MQTT PubSub functionality of AWS IoT. More information on MQTT protocol is available [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/protocols.html).
### Thing shadow
The AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK also provides APIs to provide access to thing shadows in AWS IoT. Using this SDK, users will be able to sync the data/status of their devices as JSON files to the cloud and respond to change of status requested by other applications. More information on Thing Shadow is available [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-thing-shadows.html).

<a name="credentials"></a>
## Credentials  
The SDK supports two types of credentials that correspond to the two connection types:

### X.509 certificate

For the certificate-based mutual authentication connection type. Download the [AWS IoT root CA](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem). Use the AWS IoT console to create and download the certificate and private key. You must upload these credentials along with the Python runtime code base to AR9331 on Yún board and specify the location of these files in a configuration file `aws_iot_config.h`.

### IAM credentials

For the Websocket with Signature Version 4 authentication type. You will need IAM credentials: an access key ID, a secret access key. You must also download and upload the [AWS IoT root CA](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem). A tooling script `AWSIoTArduinoYunWebsocketCredentialConfig.sh` is provided for Mac OS/Linux users to update the IAM credentials as environment variables on AR9331, Yún board.

## Installation
### Download AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK  
Click [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK-latest.zip) to download AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yún-SDK zip package and extract it to `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK` on your computer.
### Set up your Arduino Yún Board
Please follow the instructions from official website: [Arduino Yún Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoYun).

### Installation on Mac OS/Linux
Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have `expect` installed on your computer and correctly installed the Arduino IDE.  
To install `expect`:  
For Ubuntu, simply run `sudo apt-get install expect`.  
For Mac, `expect` is installed as default.  
For Arduino IDE installation on Linux, please visit [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/All).

1. Setup the Arduino Yún board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password.  
2. Make sure your computer is connected to the same network (local IP address range).  
3. Download the AWS IoT CA file from [here](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem).
4. Put your AWS IoT CA file, private key and certificate into `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/certs`. If you are using MQTT over Websocket, you can put only your AWS IoT CA file into the directory. You should have a correctly configured AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a proper policy, and a pair of AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Access Key ID, which will be used in step 6. For more information about IAM, please visit [AWS IAM home page](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).  
5. Open a terminal, cd to `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK`. Do `chmod 755 AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh` and execute it as `./AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh <Board IP> <UserName> <Board Password>`. By default for Arduino Yún Board, your user name will be `root` and your password will be `arduino`.  
	This script will upload the python runtime code base and credentials to openWRT running on the more powerful micro-controller on you Arduino Yún board.  
	This script will also download and install libraries for openWRT to implement the necessary scripting environment as well as communication protocols.

  Step 5 can take 10-15 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages (distribute, python-openssl, pip, AWSIoTPythonSDKv1.0.0).  

  NOTE: Do NOT close the terminal before the script finishes, otherwise you have to start over with step 5. Make sure you are in your local terminal before repeating step 5.  

6. Optional, only for Websocket. Open a terminal, cd to `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK`. Do `chmod 755 AWSIoTArduinoYunWebsocketCredentialConfig.sh` and execute it as `./AWSIoTArduinoYunWebsocketCredentialConfig.sh <Board iP> <UserName> <Board Password> <AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_STRING> <AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_STRING>`.  
	This script will add the given key ID and secret key onto the OpenWRT as environment variables `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.  
	
	NOTE1: You can always use this script to update your IAM credentials used on the board. The script will handle the update of the environment variables for you.  
	
	NOTE2: Please follow the instructions on the screen after the script completes to power-cycle your board to enable all the environment changes on OpenWRT.  
	
7. Copy and paste `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library` folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Mac OS default, it should be under `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.
8. Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE.  

There are the other two scripts: `AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh` and `AWSIoTArduinoYunSetupEnvironment.sh`, which are utilized in `AWSIoTArduinoYunInstallAll.sh`. You can always use `AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh` to upload your new credentials to your board. When you are in the directory `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/`, the command should be something like this:  

    ./AWSIoTArduinoYunScp.sh <Board IP> <UserName> <Board Password> <File> <Destination> 

### Installation on Windows

Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure that you have `Putty` and `WinSCP` installed on your PC. If you prefer to use other tools for SSH-ing into your Arduino Yún board and transferring files, you will have to adjust the steps below according to your tools.  
`Putty` can be downloaded from [here](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html).  
`WinSCP` can be downloaded from [here](http://winscp.net/eng/download.php).

1. Setup the Arduino Yún Cloud board and connect it to WiFi. Obtain its IP address and password.  
2. Make sure your PC is connected to the same network (local IP address range).  
3. Download the AWS IoT CA file from [here](https://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/verisign/roots/VeriSign-Class%203-Public-Primary-Certification-Authority-G5.pem).  
4. Put your AWS IoT CA file, private key and certificate into `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/certs`. If you are using MQTT over Websocket, you can put only your AWS IoT CA file into the directory. You should have a correctly configured AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) role with a proper policy, and a pair of AWS Access Key and AWS Secret Access Key ID, which will be used in step 7. For more information about IAM, please visit [AWS IAM home page](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/).  
5. Start WinSCP and upload `AWS-IoT-Python-Runtime/` folder to `/root` on the board.  
6. Use Putty to ssh into OpenWRT on your board and execute the following commands to install the necessary libraries:

		opkg update
		opkg install distribute
		opkg install python-openssl
		easy_install pip
		pip install AWSIoTPythonSDK==1.0.0
	
  It can take 10-15 minutes for the device to download and install the required packages.
  
7. Optional, only for Websocket. Use Putty to ssh into OpenWRT on your board and modify `/etc/profile` to include your IAM credentials as environment variables:  

		...
		export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<AWS_ACCES_KEY_ID_STRING>
		export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_STRING>
		...
  
  After that, run `source /etc/profile` and power-cycle the board to enable the changes.  
  
8. Copy and paste `AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-SDK/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library` folder into Arduino libraries that was installed with your Arduino SDK installation. For Windows default, it should be under `Documents/Arduino/libraries`.  
9. Restart the Arduino IDE if it was running during the installation. You should be able to see the AWS IoT examples in the Examples folder in your IDE.

<a name="message_callback"></a>
### void(\*message\_callback)(char\*, unsigned int, Message\_status\_t)]  
**Description**  
Callback function for received MQTT messages, used for plain MQTT communications as well as shadow communications.  
For plain MQTT messages, message payload and size will be passed into the callback. Message\_status\_t will be STATUS\_NORMAL. See Parameters below for more details.  
For shadow messages, JSON identifier and its size will be passed into the callback. Message\_status\_t varies for shadow messages from different topics. For accept shadow responses, Message\_status\_t will be STATUS\_SHADOW\_ACCEPTED. For reject shadow responses, Message\_status\_t will be STATUS\_SHADOW\_REJECTED. For delta shadow responses, Message\_status\_t will be STATUS\_NORMAL. See Parameters below for more details.  

**Syntax**  

	void custom_message_callback(char* msg, unsigned int length, Message_status_t status) {
		// * Access the incoming message from msg, length
		// Message payload for plain MQTT messages
		// JSON identifer for shadow messages
		// * Access the message status from status
		// STATUS_NORMAL for plain MQTT/shadow delta messages
		// STATUS_SHADOW_ACCEPTED for shadow accept responses
		// STATUS_SHADOW_REJECTED for shadow reject responses
	}

**Parameters**  
char\* - Incoming message. Message payload for plain MQTT messages and JSON identifier for shadow message/responses.  
unsigned int - Length of bytes of the incoming message.  
Message\_status\_t - Status of the incoming responses/messages. It has the following values:   

	typedef enum {
		STATUS_DEBUG = -1,
		STATUS_NORMAL = 0,
		STATUS_SHADOW_TIMEOUT = 1,
		STATUS_SHADOW_ACCEPTED = 2,
		STATUS_SHADOW_REJECTED = 3,
		STATUS_MESSAGE_OVERFLOW = 4
	} Message_status_t;

`STATUS_NORMAL` indicates that a new plain MQTT message/shadow delta message has arrived.  
`STATUS_SHADOW_TIMEOUT` indicates that the incoming message is a shadow response for an operation timeout. There was no response received for the corresponding shadow operation within the preconfigured timeout.  
`STATUS_SHADOW_ACCEPTED` indicates that the incoming message is a shadow response for accept. The corresponding shadow operation was accepted by the AWS IoT service and has succeeded.  
`STATUS_SHADOW_REJECTED` indicates that the incoming message is a shadow response for reject. The corresponding shadow operation was rejected by the AWS IoT service and has failed.  
`STATUS_MESSAGE_OVERFLOW` indicates that the size of the incoming message has exceeded the size of the internal message buffer. Internal message buffer size, configured in `aws_iot_config_SDK.h`, needs to be increased to receive the complete incoming message.  
`STATUS_DEBUG` is for SDK internal use.  

**Returns**  
No returns.

## Key features  
<a name="individualKVAccess"></a>
#### Individual Key Value Access for Shadow  
As for shadow operations (Get/Update/Delete) and shadow delta messages, instead of detailed the message content for shadow JSON document, a JSON identifier will be passed through into the registered callback so that it can be used for key/value pair access on demand through the individual key/value pair access APIs. A JSON identifier of a shadow JSON response received looks like this:  

	JSON-i

where i is an integer number.  

Note that there is a limitation on the total number of history JSON documents that can be kept on the OpenWRT side for key/value pair retrieval. The limits are:  

512 entries for shadow JSON accepted responses  
512 entries for shadow JSON rejected responses  
512 entries for shadow JSON delta messages  

Once the limits are exceeded, new incoming shadow JSON documents will overwrite history entries starting from the beginning (`JSON-0`, `JSON-1` and `JSON-2`).  

The following APIs are provided for uses to access shadow JSON key value pair from Arduino sketch in an easier manner:  
[IoT\_Error\_t getDesiredValueByKey(const char\* JSONIdentifier, const char\* key, char\* externalJSONBuf, unsigned int bufSize)](#getDesiredValueByKey)  
[IoT\_Error\_t getReportedValueByKey(const char\* JSONIdentifier, const char\* key, char\* externalJSONBuf, unsigned int bufSize)](#getReportedValueByKey)  
[IoT\_Error\_t getDeltaValueByKey(const char\* JSONIdentifier, const char\* key, char\* externalJSONBuf, unsigned int bufSize)](#getDeltaValueByKey)  
[IoT\_Error\_t getValueByKey(const char\* JSONIdentifier, const char\* key, char\* externalJSONBuf, unsigned int bufSize)](#getValueByKey)  

For a typical shadow JSON document (responses for get/update/delete), it should look like this:  

	{
		"state": {
			"desired": {
				...
			},
			"reported": {
				...
			}
		},
		...
	}

`getDesiredValueByKey` and `getReportedValueByKey` can be used to access the key value pair in the desired/reported section respectively.  

For a typical shadow JSON document (messages for delta), it should look like this:  

	{
		"state": {
			...
		},
		...
	}

`getDeltaValueByKey` can be used to access the key value pair in the delta shadow JSON messages.  

More generally, `getValueByKey` can be used to access key value pair in a more generic way where users can specify their own key patterns. Nested JSON key is denoted using `"` as the delimiter.  

For example, we have the following shadow JSON document with a JSON identifier `JSON-0`:  

	{
		"state": {
			"desired": {
				"property1": "value1",
				"property2": {
					"subproperty": "value2"
				}
			},
			"reported": {
				"property3": "value3"
			}
		},
		...
	}

To access a series of key value pair, we can use the following function calls:  

	object.getDesiredValueByKey("JSON-0", "property1", buffer, bufferSize); // Access JSONDocument["state"]["desired"]["property1"]
	object.getReportedValueByKey("JSON-0", "property3", buffer, bufferSize); // Access JSONDocument["state"]["reported"]["property3"]
	object.getDesiredValueByKey("JSON-0", "property2\"subproperty", buffer, bufferSize); // Access JSONDocument["state"]["desired"]["property2"]["subproperty"]
	
Note that the following two function calls are equivalent. They both access the nested JSON key value pair `JSONDocument["state"]["desired"]["property2"]["subproperty"]`:  

	object.getDesiredValueByKey("JSON-0", "property2\"subproperty", buffer, bufferSize);
	object.getValueByKey("JSON-0", "state\"desired\"property2\"subproperty", buffer, bufferSize);

See that `getValueByKey` is a more generic way for shadow JSON key value access.  

For detailed use cases, please check out [Examples](#example).

<a name="progressiveBackoff"></a>
#### Progressive Reconnect Back-off  
API is provided to configure the progressive back-off timing parameters:  
[IoT\_Error\_t configBackoffTiming(unsigned int baseReconnectQuietTimeSecond, unsigned int maxReconnectQuietTimeSecond, unsigned int stableConnectionTimeSecond)](#configBackoffTiming)

The auto-reconnect happens with a progressive back-off, which follows the following mechanism for reconnect quiet time:   

<h5 align="center">t<sup>current</sup> = min(2<sup>n</sup>t<sup>base</sup>, t<sup>max</sup>),</h5>  

where t<sup>current</sup> is the current reconnect quiet time, t<sup>base</sup> is the base reconnect quiet time, t<sup>max</sup> is the maximum reconnect quiet time.  

The reconnect quiet time will be doubled on disconnect and reconnect attempt until it reaches the preconfigured maximum reconnect quiet time. Once the connection is stable for over the stableConnectionTime, the reconnect quiet time will be reset to the baseReconnectQuietTime.  

If no `configBackoffTiming` gets called, the following default configuration for back-off timing will be done on `setup` call:  

	baseReconnectQuietTimeSecond = 1;
	maxReconnectQuietTimeSecond = 128;
	stableConnectionTimeSecond = 20;

<a name="offlinePublishQueueDraining"></a>
#### Offline publish requests queuing with draining  
APIs are provided to configure the offline publish requests queuing (size and drop behavior) as well as draining intervals:  
[IoT\_Error\_t configOfflinePublishQueue(unsigned int queueSize, DropBehavior\_t behavior)](#configOfflinePublishQueue)  
[IoT\_Error\_t configDrainingInterval(float numberOfSeconds)](#configDrainingInterval)  

When the client is temporarily offline and gets disconnected due to some network failure, publish requests will be queued up into an internal queue in the Python runtime on the OpenWRT side until the number of queued-up requests reaches to the size limit of the queue. Once the queue is full, offline publish requests will be discarded or replaced according to different configuration of the drop behavior:  

	typedef enum {
		DROP_OLDEST = 0,
		DROP_NEWEST = 1
	} DropBehavior_t;

Lets say we configure the size of offlinePublishQueue to be 5 and we have 7 offline publish requests coming in...  

In a `DROP_OLDEST` configuration:  

	myClient.configOfflinePublishQueue(5, DROP_OLDEST);

The internal queue should be like this when the queue is just full:  

	HEAD ['pub_req0', 'pub_req1', 'pub_req2', 'pub_req3', 'pub_req4']
	
When the 6th and the 7th publish requests are made offline, the internal queue will be like this:  

	HEAD ['pub_req2', 'pub_req3', 'pub_req4', 'pub_req5', 'pub_req6']

Since the queue is already full, the oldest requests `pub_req0` and `pub_req1` are discarded.  

In a `DROP_NEWEST` configuration:  

	myClient.configOfflinePublishQueue(5, DROP_NEWEST);

The internal queue should be like this when the queue is just full:  

	HEAD ['pub_req0', 'pub_req1', 'pub_req2', 'pub_req3', 'pub_req4']
	
When the 6th and the 7th publish requests are made offline, the internal queue will be like this:  

	HEAD ['pub_req0', 'pub_req1', 'pub_req2', 'pub_req3', 'pub_req4']

Since the queue is already full, the newest requests `pub_req5` and `pub_req6` are discarded.  

When the client is back online, connected and resubscribed to all topics that it has previously subscribed to, the draining starts. All requests in the offline publish queue will be resent at the configured draining rate.  

if no `configOfflinePublishQueue` or `configDrainingInterval` is called, the following default configuration for offline publish queuing and draining will be done on setup call:  

	offlinePublishQueueSize = 20
	dropBehavior = DROP_NEWEST
	drainingInterval = 0.5 sec

Note that before the draining process finishes, any new publish request within this time will be added to the queue. Therefore, draining rate should be higher than the normal publish rate to avoid an endless draining process after reconnect.  

Also note that disconnect event is detected based on PINGRESP MQTT packet loss. Offline publish queuing will NOT be triggered until the disconnect event gets detected. Configuring a shorter keep-alive interval allows the client to detect disconnects more quickly. Any QoS0 publish requests issued after the network failure and before the detection of the PINGRESP loss will be lost.

	#define MAX_BUF_SIZE 256										// maximum number of bytes to publish/receive
	#define MAX_SUB 15 												// maximum number of subscribe
	#define CMD_TIME_OUT 200										// maximum time to wait for feedback from AR9331, 200 = 10 sec

**Make sure you setup the client, configure it using your configuration and connect it to AWS IoT first. Remember to use certs path macros for configuration:**

    aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
    myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID);
    // myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID, true, MQTTv31, true); // Use Websocket
    myClient.config(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH);
    // myClient.configWss(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH); // Use Websocket
    myClient.connnect();

**Remember to check incoming messages in a loop**:

    void loop() { 
      ...  
      myClient.yield();
      ...
    }

**When you are using thing shadow API for a specific device shadow name, make sure you initialize the shadow with your device shadow name first:**

	myClient.shadow_init(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME); // For shadow of this device
	myClient.shadow_init("AnotherDevice"); // For another shadow

**When you are using thing shadow API, always make sure MAX\_SUB is big enough for a thing shadow request in the loop:**

	...
	myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // need 2 in MAX_SUB
	...
	void loop() {
		...
		myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // need 4 in MAX_SUB
		myClient.yield(); // unsubscribe thing shadow topics when necessary
		...
	}

**When you are using thing shadow API, make sure you set the timeout to a proper value and frequently call yield to free subscribe resources. Long timeout with low rate of yielding and high rate of shadow request will result in exhaustion of subscribe resources:**

	void loop() {
		...
		myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 5); // 5 sec timeout is fine for a request per 5 sec
		
		// myClient.shadow_get("myThingName", myCallback, 50);
		// 50 sec timeout is too long. When missing feedback happens frequently, with a rate of 1 request per 5 sec, subscribed topics will soon accumulate and exceed MAX_SUB before any of the previously-subscribed topic gets timeout and unsubscribed
		
		myClient.yield();
		
		delay(5000); // 5 sec delay
		...
	}

**Enjoy the Internet of Things!**

## Example
### BasicPubSub
This [example](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/tree/master/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library/examples/BasicPubSub) demonstrates a simple MQTT publish/subscribe using AWS IoT from Arduino Yún board. It first subscribes to a topic once and registers a callback to print out new messages to Serial monitor and then publishes to the topic in a loop. Whenever it receives a new message, it will be printed out to Serial monitor indicating the callback function has been called.

* **Hardware Required**  
Arduino Yún  
Computer connected with Arduino Yún using USB serial

* **Software Required**  
None

* **Circuit Required**  
None

* **Attention**  
Please make sure to start the example sketch after the board is fully set up and openWRT is up and connected to WiFi. See [here](#slowstartup).

* **Code**  
	Create an instance of aws\_iot\_mqtt\_client. 

		aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
		
	In `setup()`, open the Serial. Set the instance up and connect it to the AWS IoT.

		Serial.begin(115200);
		...
 		if((rc = myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID)) == 0) {
    		// Load user configuration
    		if((rc = myClient.config(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH)) == 0) {
      			// Use default connect: 60 sec for keepalive
      			if((rc = myClient.connect()) == 0) {
        			success_connect = true;
        			...
        		}
        		else {...}
        	}
        	else {...}
        }
        else {...}
        ...
          		
  	In `setup()`, subscribe to the desired topic and wait for some delay time.
  	
  	  	if((rc = myClient.subscribe("topic1", 1, msg_callback)) != 0) {
    		Serial.println(F("Subscribe failed!"));
    		Serial.println(rc);
    	}
    	delay(2000);
    	
  	In `loop()`, publish to this topic and call yield function to receive the message every 5 seconds.

### ThingShadowEcho sample app
This [example](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/tree/master/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library/examples/ThingShadowEcho) demonstrates Arduino Yún board as a device communicating with AWS IoT, syncing data into the thing shadow in the cloud and receiving commands from an app. Whenever there is a new command from the app side to change the desired state of the device, the board will receive this request and apply the change by publishing it as the reported state. By registering a delta callback function, users will be able to see this incoming message and notice the syncing of the state.  

* **Hardware Required**  
Arduino Yún  
Computer connected with Arduino Yún using USB serial

* **Software Required**  
App-side code that updates the state of the corresponding thing shadow in the cloud  
*Note:* You can also use [AWS IoT console](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/) to update the shadow data.

* **Circuit Required**  
None

* **Attention**  
Please make sure to start the example sketch after the board is fully set up and openWRT is up and connected to WiFi. See [here](#slowstartup).

* **Code**  
	Create an instance of aws\_iot\_mqtt\_client. 

		aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
		
	Create logging function for execution tracking.
	
		bool print_log(const char* src, int code) {
			...
		}
	
	In `setup()`, open the Serial. Set the instance up and connect it to the AWS IoT. Init the shadow and register a delta callback function. All steps are tracked using logging function.
	
		if(print_log("setup", myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID))) {
			if(print_log("config", myClient.config(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH))) {
				if(print_log("connect", myClient.connect())) {
        			success_connect = true;
        			print_log("shadow init", myClient.shadow_init(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME));
        			print_log("register thing shadow delta function", myClient.shadow_register_delta_func(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME, msg_callback_delta));
      			}
    		}
  		}
  		  		
  	In `loop()`, yield to check and receive new incoming messages every 1 second.
  	
  		if(myClient.yield()) {
  			Serial.println("Yield failed.");
  		}
  		delay(1000);
  		
  	For delta callback function, obtain the desired/delta state and put it as the reported state in the JSON file that needs to be updated.
  	
  		void msg_callback_delta(const char* src, unsigned int len, Message_status_t flag) {
  			if(flag == STATUS_NORMAL) {
  				// Get the whole delta section
  				print_log("getDeltaKeyValue", myClient.getDeltaValueByKey(src, "", JSON_buf, 100));
  				String payload = "{\"state\":{\"reported\":";
  				payload += delta;
  				payload += "}}";
  				payload.toCharArray(JSON_buf, 100);
  				print_log("update thing shadow", myClient.shadow_update(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME, JSON_buf, strlen(JSON_buf), NULL, 5));
  			}
  		}
  	
  	Once an update of the desired state for this device is received, a delta message will be received and displayed in the Serial monitor. The device will update this data into the cloud.

### Simple Thermostat Simulator
This [example](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun/tree/master/AWS-IoT-Arduino-Yun-Library/examples/ThermostatSimulatorDevice) demonstrates Arduino Yún as a device accepting instructions and syncing reported state in shadow in AWS IoT, which simulates a thermostat to control the temperature of a room. With the provided example App script, users will be able to get real-time temperature data coming from the board and be able to remotely set the desired temperature. This example also demonstrates how to retrieve shadow JSON data received on Arduino Yún Board.  
[AWS IoT Device SDK for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python) is used in App scripts for MQTT connections. Users can modify it to use other MQTT library according to their needs.

* **Hardware Required**  
Arduino Yún  
Computer connected with Arduino Yún using USB serial and running example App scripts

* **Software Required**  
Tkinter for App GUI  
[AWS IoT Device SDK for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python) for MQTT connectivity  
Example App script, which is included in the `ExampleAppScripts/ThermostatSimulatorApp/`  

* **Circuit Required**  
None

* **Attention**  
Please make sure to start the example sketch after the board is fully set up and openWRT is up and connected to WiFi. See [here](#slowstartup).

* **Getting started**  
Before proceeding to the following steps, please make sure you have your board set up, with all code base and credentials properly installed. Please make sure you attach the correct policy to your certificate.  
  1. Modify your configuration file to match your own credentials and host address.  
  2. Start the sketch when the board boots up. It should pass the initialization steps and then start to update shadow data. It should have a similar display in the serial monitor as follows:<p/>
  <img align="center" src = "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun-suppliemental/images/ThermostatSimulatorDevice_sketch.png"/> 
  3. On the App side, please make sure you have [Tkinter](http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/How_to_install_Tkinter) and [AWS IoT Device SDK for Python](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python) pre-installed on your computer.
  4. Copy and paste your credentials (certificate, private key and rootCA) into `ThermostatSimulatorApp/certs/`. Please make sure to keep the file names as they are downloaded and make sure the CA file name ends with `CA.crt`.  
  5. In the directory `ThermostatSimulatorApp/`, start the App script by executing:

  			python ThermostatSimulatorApp.py -e <Your AWS IoT Endpoint>  # For X.509 certificate based mutual authentication
  			python ThermostatSimulatorApp.py -e <Your AWS IoT Endpoint> -w  # For MQTT over WebSocket using IAM credentials
  			
  			
  		For more details about command line options, you can use the following command:  
  		
  			python ThermostatSimulatorApp.py -h
  		
  		You should be able to see a GUI prompt up with default reported temperature:<p/>
  <img align="center" src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun-suppliemental/images/ThermostatSimulatorApp_start.png"/>
  6. Try to input a desired temperature and click <kbd>SET</kbd>. If it succeeds, you should be able to see the desired temperature on the panel and a log printed out in the console space. The board will start continuously syncing temperature settings:<p/>
  <img align="center" src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun-suppliemental/images/ThermostatSimulatorApp_setTemp.png"/>  
  *Note:* The temperature is configured to be lower than 100 F and higher than -100 F. Error message will be printed out if there is a malformed setting:<p/>
  <img align="center" src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun-suppliemental/images/ThermostatSimulatorApp_setAboveLimits.png"/><p/>
  <img align="center" src= "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-iot-device-sdk-arduino-yun-suppliemental/images/ThermostatSimulatorApp_setBelowLimits.png"/>

* **Code**  
	Create an instance of aws\_iot\_mqtt\_client. 

		aws_iot_mqtt_client myClient;
		
	Create logging function for execution tracking.
	
		bool print_log(const char* src, int code) {
			...
		}
	
  In `setup()`, open the Serial. Set the instance up and connect it to the AWS IoT. Init the shadow and register a delta callback function. All steps are tracked using logging function.
	
        if(print_log("setup", myClient.setup(AWS_IOT_CLIENT_ID))) {
          if(print_log("config", myClient.config(AWS_IOT_MQTT_HOST, AWS_IOT_MQTT_PORT, AWS_IOT_ROOT_CA_PATH, AWS_IOT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH, AWS_IOT_CERTIFICATE_PATH))) {
            if(print_log("connect", myClient.connect())) {
              success_connect = true;
              print_log("shadow init", myClient.shadow_init(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME));
              print_log("register thing shadow delta function", myClient.shadow_register_delta_func(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME, msg_callback_delta));
            }
          }
        }

  In `loop()`, simulate the behavior of a thermostat. Check to see the difference between the desired and the reported temperature. If the desired temperature is higher, increase the reported temperature by 0.1 degree per 1 second (per loop). If the desired one is lower, decrease the reported temperature by 0.1 degree per 1 second (per loop). Increase/Decrease action will happen until the reported reaches the desired. Update the reported temperature and then yield to check if there is any new delta message.

        void loop() {
          if(success_connect) {
            if(desiredTemp - reportedTemp > 0.001) {reportedTemp += 0.1;}
            else if(reportedTemp - desiredTemp > 0.001) {reportedTemp -= 0.1;}
            dtostrf(reportedTemp, 4, 1, float_buf);
            float_buf[4] = '\0';
            sprintf_P(JSON_buf, PSTR("{\"state\":{\"reported\":{\"Temp\":%s}}}"), float_buf);
            print_log("shadow update", myClient.shadow_update(AWS_IOT_MY_THING_NAME, JSON_buf, strlen(JSON_buf), NULL, 5));
            if(myClient.yield()) {
              Serial.println("Yield failed.");
            }
            delay(1000); // check for incoming delta per 1000 ms
          }
        }

  For delta callback function, get the desired state and the desired temperature data in it. Update the desired temperature record on board so that the board knows what to do, heating or cooling.

        void msg_callback_delta(const char* src, unsigned int len, Message_status_t flag) {
        	if(flag == STATUS_NORMAL) {
        		// Get Temp section in delta messages
        		print_log("getDeltaKeyValue", myClient.getDeltaValueByKey(src, "Temp", JSON_buf, 50));				String delta = data.substring(st, ed);
        		desiredTemp = String(JSON_buf).toFloat();
        	}
        }
        
  Each time the board receives a new desired temperature different from its reported temperature. Changes will happen, synced into shadow and captured by the example App. Users will be able to see the whole process of temperature updating from the App side.
