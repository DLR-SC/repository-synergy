# PyNSXv
PyNSXv is a high level python based library that exposes ready to use work-flows and a CLI tool that can be used to control VMware NSX for vSphere

PyNSXv can be used in two different ways, as a library by importing the files in the /library subdirectory into your code, or as a CLI tool by executing `pynsxv`on the command line after installation. To install PyNSXv you can use PIP on your system

#Using PyNSXv as a CLI Tool

After you installed PyNSXv, the first thing you have to do is to create your a `ini` file that contains the host names and credentials of your vCenter and NSX Manager. 

If you have multiple NSX environments, you can create multiple `ini` files and reference to them using the `-i` command line option. By default PyNSXv will look for a file called `nsx.ini` in the path your are running the pynsxv command in.

The `ini` file has the following format:
```ini
# [nsxraml]
# nsxraml_file = <>
# Uncomment the above section and add the path to the raml spec you want to use instead of the bundled version

[nsxv]
nsx_manager = <nsx_manager_IP>
nsx_username = admin
nsx_password = <nsx_manager_password>

[vcenter]
vcenter = <VC_IP_or_Hostname>
vcenter_user = administrator@domain.local
vcenter_passwd = <vc_password>

[defaults]
transport_zone = <transport_zone_name>
datacenter_name = <vcenter datacenter name>
edge_datastore = <datastore name to deploy edges in>
edge_cluster = <vcenter cluster for edge gateways>
```

After placing the `nsx.ini` file in you path, you can run pynsxv from your shell or cmd prompt. On Linux and Mac simply use `pynsxv` followed by the subcommand. On Windows you will need to type `pynsxv.exe` followed by the subcommand:

```
??? pynsxv -h
usage: pynsxv [-h] [-i INI] [-v] [-d] {lswitch,dlr,esg,dhcp,dfw,usage} ...

PyNSXv Command Line Client for NSX for vSphere

positional arguments:
  {lswitch,dlr,esg,dhcp,dfw,usage}
    lswitch             Functions for logical switches
    dlr                 Functions for distributed logical routers
    esg                 Functions for edge services gateways
    dhcp                Functions for Edge DHCP
    dfw                 Functions for distributed firewall
    usage               Functions to retrieve NSX-v usage statistics

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INI, --ini INI     nsx configuration file
  -v, --verbose         increase output verbosity
  -d, --debug           print low level debug of http transactions
```

Here is an example output using the lswitch subcommand:
```
??? pynsxv lswitch list
+---------------------+----------------+
| LS name             | LS ID          |
|---------------------+----------------|
| edge_ls             | virtualwire-63 |
| dlr_ls              | virtualwire-64 |
+---------------------+----------------+
```

Each subcommand has its own set of subcommands, as well as arguments.  
You can see what is available by using `-h` after the first subcommand:
```
??? pynsxv lswitch -h
usage: cli.py lswitch [-h] [-t TRANSPORT_ZONE] [-n NAME] command

Functions for logical switches

positional arguments:
  command
                            create: create a new logical switch
                            read:   return the virtual wire id of a logical switch
                            delete: delete a logical switch"
                            list:   return a list of all logical switches


optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TRANSPORT_ZONE, --transport_zone TRANSPORT_ZONE
                        nsx transport zone
  -n NAME, --name NAME  logical switch name, needed for create, read and delete
```


You can also use the `-v` switch of the main pynsxv command to switch to a json formated output for use with shell scripts

<a name="Using PyNSXv as a Python Library"></a>
#Using PyNSXv as a Python Library

When using PyNSXv as a Python library you can either download the individual modules in `/library` of this repo and import them in your code, or you can install PyNSXv and import the modules from your python path for pip installed modules.   

To use the modules you will also need to have at least the `nsxramlclient` installed (https://github.com/vmware/nsxramlclient).  
You will also need a copy of the latest RAML API Spec of NSX for vSphere (https://github.com/vmware/nsxraml).

Import the module you want to use, as well as the NsxClient Class of the `nsxramlclient`.  
Then instantiate a session object of the NsxClient Class, and pass this session object to the function you want to use out of the module imported from PyNSXv. Here's an example:

```ipython
??? ipython
Python 2.7.11 (default, Jun 17 2016, 20:01:51)
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

IPython 4.2.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python.

```

All module function have inline documentation available to guide you through the needed parameters:

```
In [1]: help(logical_switch_list)

logical_switch_list(client_session)
    This function returns all logical switches found in NSX
    :param client_session: An instance of an NsxClient Session
    :return: returns a tuple, the first item is a list of tuples with item 0 containing the LS Name as string
             and item 1 containing the LS id as string. The second item contains a list of dictionaries containing
             all logical switch details

brew link libxslt --force
```

Finaly we are ready to install PyNSXv using pip:
```shell
sudo pip install pynsxv
```

**NOTE**: OSX 10.11 El Capitan introduces problems due to an outdated dependency `six`. Due to OSX's new System Integrity Protection (SIP) pip cannot remove the outdated version and install the needed one:
http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/209572/how-to-use-pip-after-the-os-x-el-capitan-upgrade/210021#210021
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31900008/oserror-errno-1-operation-not-permitted-when-installing-scrapy-in-osx-10-11

If you run into this error:

`OSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/tmp/pip-nIfswi-uninstall/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/six-1.4.1-py2.7.egg-info'` 

You should install a new non-bundled python version:
```shell
brew install python

sudo pip uninstall pynsxv
sudo pip uninstall six
sudo pip uninstall PyYAML
sudo pip uninstall pyraml-parser
sudo pip uninstall nsxramlclient

pip install pyopenssl
pip install pynsxv
```
