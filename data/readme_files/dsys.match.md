**Match** makes it easy to search for images that look similar to each other. Using a state-of-the-art perceptual hash, it is invariant to scaling and 90 degree rotations. Its HTTP API is quick to integrate and flexible for a number of reverse image search applications. Kubernetes and Elasticsearch allow Match to scale to billions of images with ease while giving you full control over where your data is stored. Match uses the awesome [ascribe/image-match](https://github.com/ascribe/image-match) under the hood for most of the image search legwork.

## Getting Started

If you already have ElasticSearch running:
```
$ docker run -e ELASTICSEARCH_URL=https://daisy.us-west-1.es.amazonaws.com -it dsys/match
```

If you want to run ElasticSearch locally as well, have [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your system, clone this repository and type:
```
$ make dev
```

Match is packaged as a Docker container ([dsys/match](https://hub.docker.com/r/dsys/match/) on Docker Hub), making it highly portable and scalable to billions of images. You can configure a few options using environment variables:

* **WORKER_COUNT** *(default: `4`)*

  The number of gunicorn workers to spin up.

* **ELASTICSEARCH_URL** *(default: `elasticsearch:9200`)*

  A URL pointing to the Elasticsearch database where image signatures are to be stored. If you don't want to host your own Elasticsearch cluster, consider using [AWS Elasticsearch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/). That's what we use.

* **ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX** *(default: images)*

  The index in the Elasticsearch database where image signatures are to be stored.

* **ELASTICSEARCH_DOC_TYPE** *(default: images)*

  The doc type used for storing image signatures.


### Using in your own Kubernetes cluster

You can configure the service, replication controller, and secret like so:

```yaml
# match-service.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: match
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 80
    protocol: TCP
  selector:
    app: match
```

```yaml
# match-rc.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: match
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    app: match
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: match
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: match
        image: dsys/match:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        env:
        - name: WORKER_COUNT
          value: "4"
        - name: ELASTICSEARCH_URL
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: match
              key: elasticsearch.url
        - name: ELASTICSEARCH_INDEX
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: match
              key: elasticsearch.index
        - name: ELASTICSEARCH_DOC_TYPE
          valueFrom:
            secretKeyRef:
              name: match
              key: elasticsearch.doc-type
```

```yaml
# match-secret.yml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: match
data:
  # https://daisy.us-west-1.es.amazonaws.com (change me)
  elasticsearch.url: aHR0cHM6Ly9kYWlzeS51cy13ZXN0LTEuZXMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbQ==

  # images
  elasticsearch.index: aW1hZ2Vz

  # images
  elasticsearch.doc-type: aW1hZ2Vz
```

## API

Match has a simple HTTP API. All request parameters are specified via `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or `multipart/form-data`.

  The image to add to the database. It may be provided as a URL via `url` or as a `multipart/form-data` file upload via `image`.

* **filepath** *(required)*

  The path to save the image to in the database. If another image already exists at the given path, it will be overwritten.

* **metadata** *(default: None)*

  The path of the image signature in the database.

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "error": [],
  "method": "delete",

---

### POST `/search`
